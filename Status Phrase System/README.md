# Status Phrase System - Keep your stream to appear fresh!
by Andreas "Nekres" G.

**This module adds a phrase to your broadcast title and changes it in a specific time intervall. This is cool if you want your stream to appear new and fresh in the broadcasts list.**

This is how it would look when you set it to be displayed after your main broadcast title (default setting):
![Error: Unable to load image!](http://i.imgur.com/ReufTpb.png)
And this is how it would look when you set the phrase to be displayed in front of your main broadcast title:

**WARNING:**  
The script will try to detect the very first (position set to be in front.) or the very last (position set to be in back.) symbol in your broadcast's title that is your separator. Therefore, do NOT use the separator in a phrase you want to add! Phrases including the separator will be cutted!   
Also, if you want to use the separator symbol in your main broadcast title, too, make sure to place another one after or before (depending on setting.) your title with a space between. (Example: 'My»awe»some»stream! » Example phrase hello world').

**Default Phrases**
Random preset phrases can be generated by clicking the 'Random' button in the statusphrases webpanel and added when appealing.
